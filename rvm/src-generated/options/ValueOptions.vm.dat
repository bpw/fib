V maxSystemTroubleRecursionDepth int  3
If we get deeper than this in one of the System Trouble functions, try to die.


# NOTE: Although this option can be set to arbitrary values,
#       setting it to a smaller quantum than what is actually supported
#       by pthread nanosleep on the target platform will reduce the
#       effectiveness of the Adaptive System.  Therefore, this setting
#       should be verified by running a relatively long running program
#       on an unload machine and enabling -X:aos:reportInterruptStats=true
V interruptQuantum int 4
Timer interrupt scheduling quantum in ms


V schedulingMultiplier int 1
Scheduling quantum = interruptQuantum * schedulingMultiplier


V TraceThreadScheduling int 0 traceThreadScheduling
Trace actions taken by thread scheduling


V VerboseStackTracePeriod int 0 verboseStackTrace
Trace every nth time a stack trace is created


V EdgeCounterFile String null edgeCounterFile
Input file of edge counter profile data


V CBSCallSamplesPerTick int 8
How many CBS call samples (Prologue/Epilogue) should we take per time tick


V CBSCallSampleStride int 2
Stride between each CBS call sample (Prologue/Epilogue) within a sampling window


V CBSMethodSamplesPerTick int 0
How many CBS method samples (any yieldpoint) should we take per time tick


V CBSMethodSampleStride int 3
Stride between each CBS method sample (any yieldpoint) within a sampling window


V TuningForkTraceFile String null tfTraceFile
Filename to use for TuningFork trace generation


V forceOneCPU int -1
Force all threads to run on one CPU.  The argument specifies which CPU (starting from 0).


# Octet: command-line options
# Octet: TODO: the change from 100 to 300 was part of the counter branch; I'm not sure if the results were conclusive enough to support changing it.
# In any case, it's unrelated to RBA.
V octetWaitSpinCount int 300
When waiting, how many spin loops to do before switching to pthread yield?


V octetWaitYieldCount int 1
When waiting, how many yields to do before switching to a pthread condition wait?


V octetIODir String null
Where to store the visualized CFGS, plus potentially other input/output files


V staticRaceDir String null
Path where Chord static race detection output is present
